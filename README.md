# Prediction of Diabetes Patients

## 1. Brief Description

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model for the prediction of diabetes patients. It utilizes a dataset of health-related features to classify individuals into diabetic or non-diabetic categories. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes.

## 2. Data Sources

The dataset used in this project is publicly available from the [Data](https://github.com/SumitAkhadkar/Prediction_of_Diabetes_Patients/blob/main/diabetes.csv). The dataset contains various health-related attributes such as glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age, along with a binary label indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not.

## 3. Task

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Accurate prediction of diabetes patients can help healthcare professionals and individuals make informed decisions and provide timely interventions. The task at hand is to create a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on relevant features such as age, BMI, family history, and other health-related factors.

To get started, you can clone this repository and follow the instructions in the notebooks for step-by-step guidance on data preprocessing and model training.

## 4. Results and Evaluation

The model's performance is assessed using various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results of the model's predictions are presented in the project's notebooks, highlighting its performance and any insights gained from the analysis.

## 5. Future Work

There are several avenues for potential future work, including:

- Fine-tuning the existing models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Exploring additional feature engineering to enhance model performance.
- Scaling the project to handle larger datasets and real-time predictions.
- Building a user-friendly web application for healthcare professionals.
